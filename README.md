# Cryptography Toolkit - Python & Streamlit

A web application built with Python and Streamlit that provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using various classical and modern cryptographic algorithms. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how these ciphers work.

![Cryptography Toolkit Documentation](Cryptography_Toolkit_Document.docx)


## Features 

The toolkit includes implementations of the following algorithms:

* **Classical Ciphers (Substitution):**
    * Caesar Cipher
    * Affine Cipher
* **Classical Ciphers (Polyalphabetic):**
    * Vigenere Cipher
    * Playfair Cipher
    * Hill Cipher (2x2 and 3x3)
* **Classical Ciphers (Transposition):**
    * Rail Fence Cipher
    * Row Transposition Cipher
* **Mechanical Ciphers:**
    * Rotor Machine (Enigma-like simulation)
* **Modern Block Ciphers:**
    * DES (Data Encryption Standard) - *Implemented from scratch for educational demonstration.*
    * AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - *Using the secure `pycryptodome` library with GCM mode.*

The application provides explanations, formulas, and visualizations (where applicable) for each algorithm.

## Setup Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the project files onto your computer.
2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    (Recommended to keep dependencies isolated)
    ```bash
    # Navigate into the project folder
    cd Cryptography_App

    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it:
    # On Windows (cmd/powershell):
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file. Make sure your virtual environment is active first.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application üöÄ

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt).
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`Cryptography_App/`) in your terminal.
3.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
4.  Streamlit will automatically open the application in your default web browser. If not, open your browser and go to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Important Security Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

* The **DES** implementation included here is built from scratch primarily for educational purposes to show the internal steps. **DES is considered insecure and should NOT be used for protecting real data.**
* The **AES** implementation uses the reputable `pycryptodome` library and the secure GCM mode, which is suitable for real-world use *if managed correctly* (key management, etc.).
* The classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenere, Playfair, etc.) are **not secure** by modern standards and are included only for historical and educational context.

This project is intended for learning and demonstration, not for production-level security applications.

......................................................................................................
#### For Running please enter this below all Commands on terminal one by one :
python -m venv venv

./venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

./venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "import streamlit as st; print(st.__version__)"

./venv/Scripts/python.exe -m streamlit run app.py


### For AES Algorithm Install new libraray

./venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install pycryptodome
